## Welcome to City Settlers

This repository is currently under construction. Most of the code exists on [this Github repo](https://github.com/Visheshk/LC2) for now, and the game exists on [this page](https://citysettlers.visheshk.net).
Eventually things will be better organized, there will be a presentation here that explains the game, and there will likely be versions of the game you can play without direct instructions from us. For now, you should talk to us.
